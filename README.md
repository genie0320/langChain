# Ordinary Coder's Lab
> Exploring Possibilities, One Project at a Time.

This repo is, uh, basically just my messy coding corner. I fumble around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and recently dipped my toes in databases and, gulp, some AI stuff. Definitely not a pro, just an average person tinkering with tech for fun (and maybe a bit of self-learning). It's not the most efficient or polished, but hey, if you're curious and happen to stumble upon it, feel free to have a look.

## History so far

So far, I've dabbled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enough to get by but not exactly developer material. Lately, I've been trying to wrap my head around Python, Langchain, and even some sLLM stuff (don't judge, it's fascinating!). Still very much a beginner, but hey, gotta start somewhere, right?

## My goal for now.
My ultimate dream? Building an AI business consultant, like a friendly genie in a bottle, but for giving quality advice instead of wishes. It's a wild idea, I know, and I'm just a beginner tinkering away. But hey, if even one person's dream gets a boost from this crazy project, I'd be over the moon (or should I say, over the cloud?).

## Licensing

My code is a bit shy and prefers to stay private. Please respect its boundaries, like giving someone space when they need it.
